## How to Play

### **Setup Phase**
1. Each player has their own 10x10 grid.
2. Players place their ships by entering:
   - Starting coordinates (`x y`).
   - Direction (`r` for right or `d` for down`).
3. Ships cannot overlap and must fit within the grid.

### **Gameplay**
1. Players alternate turns to fire shots by entering target coordinates (`x y`).
2. Shots result in:
   - **Hit**: If a ship occupies the target cell (`HH`).
   - **Miss**: If no ship is in the target cell (`M`).
3. Players are notified if they sink a ship (e.g., "You sunk the Battleship!").

### **Winning the Game**
- A player wins by sinking all their opponent's ships.
- If no winner is determined after a set number of turns, the game ends in a draw.
